# IconExport
Fork of the deprecated IconExport module from TechNet

## Planned Additions
- [ ] Native PowerShell without in-line C#
- [ ] Use of the .NET Core `[Drawing.Icon]::ExtractIcon()` method (if running as PS 7) which allows for both icon index and size, which .NET Framework doesn't contain, only providing `ExtractAssociatedIcon()`.
- [ ] Support for UNC paths.
- [ ] Extracting to the source directory by default.
- [ ] Automatically naming the icon after its source, with the index and size appended to avoid clobbering. The hidden FileInfo and DirectoryInfo property `.PSIsContainer` would help there.

## Possible Additions
- [ ] Support for embedded icons in resources other than EXE and DLL... e.g.:
  - [ ] MSI. No idea how this would be done yet.
  - [ ] LNK. First getting the icon path and then extracting from there.
  - [ ] .Website (?). Easy enough, as if I recall correctly, the file follows an INI format with the field pointing to an icon file.
- [ ] Support for index and sizes other than 32px in PowerShell Desktop.
